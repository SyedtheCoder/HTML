<p>Cricket is a bat-and-ball sport played between two teams of 11 players. <br>
     The objective is to score more runs than the opposing team while also dismissing their players. <br>
      The game is played in different formats, including Test matches (lasting up to five days),
      One Day Internationals (ODIs) (50 overs per team),
       and T20s (20 overs per team). <br>
       A match consists of batting, bowling, and fielding, with players aiming to score runs by
       hitting the ball and preventing the opposing team from scoring. <br>
        The sport is governed by the 
        International Cricket Council (ICC) and follows specific rules and regulations.
